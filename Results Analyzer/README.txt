This little script I wrote provides some BASIC exam results analysis.

To get this to run:
1.Navigate to the directory where you've stored the analyze.py & Result.csv file (has to be in the same file) via terminal
2.Enter the commmand in terminal: python3 analyze.py
3.Enter the file name you want to analyse. E.g. ExamResults2018.csv.
 

N.B.The script works on csv files (the exact structure/layout of which you can infer
 based on the sample csv file I've provided)
N.B. This script simply computes the mean of the module => results may be skewed.
